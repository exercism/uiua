# Positive Mean

Calculate the average (mean) of only the positive numbers in a non-empty list.


## Instructions
Given a list of mixed positive and negative numbers, you need to keep only positives (>0). Then, calculate the mean value of the remaining numbers.

## Example
Input: [10 -5 3 0]

Positive numbers: [10 3]

Mean: (10 + 3) / 2 = 6.5
