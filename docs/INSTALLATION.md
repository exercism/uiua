# Installation

[Pre-compiled Uiua binaries][releases] are available, so compiling isn't necessary.
See the [official installation guide][install-guide] for the latest instructions, including IDE integration and fonts.

~~~~exercism/note
Currently our online test-runner uses version `0.14.0-dev.7`.
With Uiua's rapid development process, that might be subject to change, so keep this in mind if you can't reproduce the testing results from the website.

Once downloaded to your intended location, youâ€™ll need to add Uiua to your system PATH.

- **macOS:** Use Finder to open `Applications > Utilities > Terminal`. Enter `export PATH="/path/to/uiua:$PATH"` to run Uiua from any location.

- **Windows:** Open "Edit Environment Variables" from the Start menu. In "Path," add your Uiua folder.

- **Linux:** Open Terminal and add `export PATH="/path/to/uiua:$PATH"` to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` for easy access.
