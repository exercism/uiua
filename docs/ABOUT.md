# About

[Uiua][uiua homepage] is an [array-][array-oriented programming] and [stack-oriented][stack-oriented programming] programming language that emphasizes concise, point-free code through [tacit programming][tacit programming].
Its design is influenced by languages like [APL][apl-wiki] and J, which also prioritize powerful array manipulations.
Uiua’s core operations are represented by symbols, and many built-in functions have symbolic representations.
Function names like "pick" and "length" are automatically converted to their respective glyphs, `⊡` and `⧻`, without requiring special input from users.

Created and maintained by [Kai Schmidt][kai schmidt github], Uiua is an open-source language - currently its experimental stages.
The language prioritizes stability in its core functions.
Experimental features are marked, which our exercise framework generally avoids.
